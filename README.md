# Pseudonaja_location_map

This repository shows the localities of Eastern Brown snakes used in an upcoming study. Temperature data is also overlaid on the map.

NOTE: this map was created with tmap version 3, which is now outdated. If you run the same code with the newest version of tmap (tmap version 4) you will not be able to recreate the below map. To change to version 3 the following code has been added to the start of pseudonaja_map.R script:
- Download tmap tmap_3.3-4.tar.gz from https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/tmap/
- Run the following code
- detach("package:tmap", unload = TRUE)
- install.packages("C:...YOUR DIRECTORY..../tmap_3.3-4.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
- library(tmap)
